Fast fashion refers to a business model in the fashion industry that focuses on producing clothing quickly, cheaply, and in large quantities. 
Brands that follow this model rapidly translate trends from the runway or celebrity culture into garments available in stores or online for consumers. 
This process emphasizes low costs and frequent new collections, sometimes releasing new items every week.

The fast fashion model often relies on mass production, inexpensive materials, and low-wage labor in countries with less regulation, contributing to environmental concerns and poor working conditions. 
The clothes are usually of lower quality, designed to be worn for a short time before being discarded, which leads to significant waste and pollution.

Fast fashion as we know it emerged in the late 20th century, around the 1990s and early 2000s, as global fashion brands like Zara, H&M, and Forever 21 began to dominate the market with their ability to produce trendy, affordable clothing at an unprecedented speed.

Several factors contributed to the rise of fast fashion:

1. **Globalization**: Advances in transportation and communication made it easier for companies to source cheap labor and materials from developing countries. Factories in places like China, Bangladesh, and Vietnam became hubs for mass-producing clothing at lower costs.
2. **Technological advancements**: Automation and modern manufacturing techniques allowed fashion companies to cut production times and increase efficiency. This enabled brands to release new collections much faster than traditional seasonal cycles.
3. **Consumer demand for affordable fashion**: With more consumers wanting the latest trends but not necessarily willing or able to pay luxury prices, fast fashion brands filled the gap by offering cheap, stylish clothes. The rise of social media in the 2000s further fueled demand, as people began to expect constant wardrobe updates to stay relevant.
4. **Shift from seasonal collections to constant releases**: Traditional fashion used to operate on a seasonal cycle (spring/summer, fall/winter). Fast fashion brands started producing multiple mini-seasons, sometimes releasing new items every week or two, making fashion more disposable.

By the early 2000s, fast fashion had become a dominant force in the industry, catering to consumers' desire for trendy and affordable clothing but raising significant concerns about environmental damage, labor exploitation, and the unsustainable nature of the industry.
