## Texture & Fabrics

- Focus on soft silk for the pajamas to evoke comfort, paired with smooth cotton for a crisp and clean look.
- The visual contrast between the black-and-white outfits on the rack and the modelâ€™s pastel pajamas will create a strong thematic statement.
- This contrast emphasizes the abundance and wastefulness of fast fashion while allowing the model's soft, luxurious look to stand out as a symbol of reimagined value.

## Accessories

Primary Look: 
- Soft black thin scarf.
- Small Earrings.

Secondary Look:
- White collar.
- White bandana.
- Small Earrings.
- Rings and bracelet.

## Shoes

	- The subdued tones of the footwear ensure that the focus remains on the pajamas while still providing a polished look.
Secondary Look:
- Black Boots.
	- The black boots add a bold, structured contrast to the softness of the pajamas.
	- The boots symbolize strength and durability, much like the idea that fashion items can last longer when given a second chance.
