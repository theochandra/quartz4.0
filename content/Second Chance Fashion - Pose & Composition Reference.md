Pose and composition references for the model
- The model in relaxed, natural posesâ€”sitting or leaning casually to reflect the pajama style.
- Play with the juxtaposition of the model standing out against the rack of clothes, using angles and depth to emphasize the contrast between simplicity and excess.
